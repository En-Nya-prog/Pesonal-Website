      <h2>My Journey So Far</h2>
      <p>
        Moving from a border-town named Sampa in the Bono Region to the bustling city of Accra to further my tertiary education, I discovered my passion for technology early on.
        I wasn't familiar with coding until I joined the Computer Science program at Palm University College, where I learned the fundamentals of programming and web development.
        Since then, I've been on a journey to master the art of coding, focusing on building user-friendly websites and applications.
        From building websites for my church to deploying projects on GitHub Pages, I've always enjoyed turning ideas into functional, user-friendly platforms. 
        I love learning, organizing code with clarity, and using tech to empower others.
      </p>
      <p>
        My current goals include learning more about full-stack development, improving accessibility on the web, and contributing to open-source projects.
